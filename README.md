## Motivation
The main purpose of this app is to demonstrate usage of Dagger and RxJava

- A homescreen widget that shows your stock portolio in a resizable grid.
- Based off the [ministocks widget](https://github.com/niteshpatel/ministocks) but allowing unlimited tickers in a grid so you don't have to worry about sizing.
- Stocks can be sorted by dragging and dropping the list.
- Only performs automatic fetching of stocks during trading hours and weekdays.
- **Now has Graphs!** Using [android graphview] (http://www.android-graphview.org/)

## Importing and exporting
- You can import a list of tickers by selecting **import tickers** from the settings menu. All you need is a textfile with your tickers in *comma-separated* format.
- You can also export your tickers to a file by selecting **export tickers**.
- You can set the font size in Settings.

## Future versions
*Future versions will include:*
- Ability to pick indices such as **^DJI**.
