# StockTicker
[Google play link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.premnirmal.tickerwidget)
- A homescreen widget that shows your stock portolio in a resizable grid.
- Based off the [ministocks widget](https://github.com/niteshpatel/ministocks) but allowing unlimited tickers in a grid so you don't have to worry about sizing.
- Stocks can be sorted by dragging and dropping the list.
- Only performs automatic fetching of stocks during trading hours and weekdays.

## Importing and exporting
*Are you tired of re-entering your tickers ever time you install a new finance app, or when you get a new phone? Fuggedaboutit!*
- You can import a list of tickers by selecting **import tickers** from the settings menu. All you need is a textfile with your tickers in *comma-separated* format.
- You can also export your tickers to a file by selecting **export tickers**.
- You can set the font size in Settings.

## Note
The main purpose of me building this app is to practice usage of Square's Dagger library and Netflix's RxJava library.

## Future versions
*Future versions will include:*
- Ability to set a custom refresh interval
- Ability to pick indices such as **^DJI**.
- Ability to change the app theme and colors
