# StockTicker

[Google play link]()

- A homescreen widget that shows your stock portolio in a resizable grid.

- Based off the [ministocks widget](https://github.com/niteshpatel/ministocks) but allowing unlimited tickers in a grid so you don't have to worry about sizing.

## Importing and exporting

*Are you tired of re-entering your tickers ever time you install a new finance app, or when you get a new phone? Fuggedaboutit! *

- You can import a list of tickers by selecting **import tickers** from the settings menu. All you need is a textfile with your tickers in *comma-separated* format.

- You can also export your tickers to a file by selecting **export tickers**.

- You can set the font size in Settings


## Note

The main purpose of me building this app is to practice usage of Square's Dagger library and Netflix's RxJava library.

## Future versions

*Future versions will include:*
- Ability to set a custom refresh interval
- Ability to pick indices such as **^DJI**.
- Ability to change the app theme and colors
