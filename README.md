# StockTicker
[![Google play link](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.premnirmal.tickerwidget)
- A homescreen widget that shows your stock portolio in a resizable grid.
- Based off the [ministocks widget](https://github.com/niteshpatel/ministocks) but allowing unlimited tickers in a grid so you don't have to worry about sizing.
- Stocks can be sorted by dragging and dropping the list.
- Only performs automatic fetching of stocks during trading hours and weekdays.
- **Now has Graphs!** Using [android graphview] (http://www.android-graphview.org/)

## Importing and exporting
- You can import a list of tickers by selecting **import tickers** from the settings menu. All you need is a textfile with your tickers in *comma-separated* format.
- You can also export your tickers to a file by selecting **export tickers**.
- You can set the font size in Settings.

## Note
The main purpose of me building this app is to practice usage of Square's Dagger library and Netflix's RxJava library.

## Future versions
*Future versions will include:*
- Ability to pick indices such as **^DJI**.
- Ability to change the app theme and colors
